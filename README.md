Simulate the Monty Hall problem thousands of times to get the real answer.

## The Monty Hall problem

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

The solution is very unintuitive:

>! You double your chances by switching.

We could validate the solution by running the game many times and checking the results. Perfect job for a computer.
